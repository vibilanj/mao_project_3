# Lines beginning with '#' are considered as comments and do not get parsed as
#   schedule requirements.
#
# There are two types of schedule requirements:
#   - EVENTS are fixed in time and cannot be moved by the scheduler.
#   - TASKS are flexible and are moved around by the scheduler.
#
# Here is how you define EVENTS and TASKS:
#   EVENT [name] [day] [start_time] [end_time]
#   TASK [name] [time_required] [start_day] [start_time] [end_day] [end_time]
#
# Important Notes:
#   - The program does not check if two events take place at the same time.
#       Make sure you provide the correct schedule requirements.
#   - Names are purely for display as all events and tasks are handled the
#       same way. Only the first five characters will be displayed in the
#       schedule.
#   - Days must be weekdays and written in full. e.g. "Monday", "Wednesday".
#   - Times must be between 09:00 and 19:00 and can only be specified up to
#       30 minute intervals. e.g. "11:00", "17:30".
#   - Time required must be an integer.
#   - The program might not always be able to fulfill all the requirements.
#       The optimizer solution will always be displayed but this be wrong.
#
# This file is a valid schedule requirements file. By default, the program will
#   look for the file called 'schedule.txt'. Feel free to edit this file or
#   write another file with the same rules specified above. To run the program
#   with a different requirements file, you can pass in the file name as an
#   optional argument replacing the text in square brackets:
#   `python main.py --schedule [another-file.txt]`
